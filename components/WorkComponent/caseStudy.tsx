          Considering our young audience, we adopted the double diamond design
          process to ensure the app is user-friendly and interactive. Our
          research began with online surveys and interviews to understand what
          our target users want from an educational app. We found that children
          often feel anxious about learning math due to complex calculations and
          monotonous teaching methods.

          All our social media strategies are tailored to our potential users,
          primarily children aged 6-18 or individuals interested in learning
          Vedic math. After understanding their needs, we created content that
          made learning easy and rewarding, addressing their fear of complex
          calculations and introducing them to the Vedic system.

          The success of any mobile application hinges on effective social media
          marketing. For Vedarya, we developed a style guide to ensure
          consistent messaging across all platforms, drawing attention to key
          information and maintaining brand consistency. We used buttons,
          typography, and colors subtly to create a warm and inviting user
          experience, which helped build a strong bond with the app.
